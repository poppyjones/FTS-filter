# FTS Filter

This project builds upon the roller derby team rankings from Flat Track Stats in an attempt to make a tool that can support leagues in finding suitable opponents by filtering by certain criteria (wftda status and games played since the pandemic) or by displaying recent wins and losses along with each team.

Currently the program is quite primitive. It is run through the terminal and will promt you to name an output file and to decide what information/filters you want to add.
